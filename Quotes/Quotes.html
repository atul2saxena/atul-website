				Tao of Seneca - Practical Letters from a Stoic Master
				<blockquote>"When we seek to destroy others, we often hurt ourself. Because it is the self that wants to be destroyed." <br>- Pierce, Community</blockquote>
		On Saving Time
		'Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands'
		Don't waste time idly
		Nothing is ours except time, you cannot repay time

		On Discursiveness in Reading
		Choose wisely what you read, and only read one book at a time
		'It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor'

		On True and False Friendship
		You must pass judgment before you make one your friend
		It is equally faulty to trust all with your secrets and none
		Tell your friend all your secrets that you would share with yourself

		On the Terrors of Death
		You can die at any moment from a king or a slave, there is no point worrying about it
		"for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks"

		On the Philosophers' Mean
		Our exterior should conform to society, but inwardly we should be different, otherwise we will repel those whom we are trying to improve
		Being a philosopher doesn't mean that you need to you have to live in penance, just plain/neat living
		Fear follows hope - when our memory recalls tortures of the past, our foresight anticipates them --> live in the present

		On Sharing Knowledge
		No good thing is pleasant to possess without good friends to share it with
		Discussing with people is better than just reading words

		On Crowds
		There are too many temptations and vices when you hang out with crowds
		It is too easy to side with the majority, and much harm can be done to your soul from just one vice
		When you are in a crowd, either you must imitate the crowd, or loath them
		If you have to go in a crowd, look inward, and try to find those who will better yourself
		The things you learn are meant for you, and don't need to be ostentatiously shared

		On the Philosopher's Seclusion
		Only fall to sleep when you must and your eyes are wary
		Nothing but the soul is worthy of wonder
		Avoid pleasure; indulge your body only as much as you need to

		On the Philosopher's Friendship
		A wise man can do without friends but he does not have to desire to do so
		Be self-sufficient
		Only a wise men is pleased with himself

		On Living to Oneself
		Pray to god only for those things that you pray for openly

		On the Blush of Modesty
		Wisdom cannot remove blushing; we cannot forbid these feelings just as we cannot summon them
